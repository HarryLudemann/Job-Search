      <h3 class="h3 m-5">Project Methodology Statement:</h3>
      <p class="m-5">We are taking a Prototype methodology approach for our project. We have chosen this methodology as this gives us the best flexibility, allowing us to go from iteration to development regularly. We favour this as we often find ourselves wanting to change something during development, to match developing conditions, adapt to issues or just including new ideas. This methodology also focuses on improved quality of the product, as the process involves more stakeholder/user interaction feedback and regular evaluation, and less risk as it promises no deployable end product.</h3>

      <h3 class="h3 m-5">Competing Product Analysis:</h3>
      <p class="m-5">The main difference between our product and SJS(Student Job Search) is that our product has a student profile page, this is were employeers can filter through students who are looking for work without students having to apply.</h3>
